This is a **preload landing page** designed to enhance user experience while the main [Movie Recommendation App](https://movie-recommendation-system-using-eikc.onrender.com/) (hosted on [Render](https://render.com)) **wakes up** from cold start. Free-tier Render apps can go idle after inactivity — this preloader offers a clean, cinematic “loading” screen and redirects users smoothly once the app is ready.

Here is the [Main Website GITHUB repo](https://github.com/Vishnu-Jagadeesan/Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Machine-Learning)

> 🕒 Helps avoid confusion caused by blank pages or `about:blank` while the backend starts.

## ❄️ Why a Preloader?

Render’s **free web services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity**, leading to:

- Delays (10–30 seconds) when accessing your app
- An empty browser state (e.g., `about:blank`) before the server responds

This GitHub-hosted preloader:
- Immediately loads via **GitHub Pages (no cold start)**
- Displays a **movie-themed loading animation**
- **Auto-redirects** to your Render app after ~6 seconds (customizable)

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3 (no JS dependencies)
- Typing animation and glowing film reel loader
- Responsive design
- GitHub Pages for deployment
